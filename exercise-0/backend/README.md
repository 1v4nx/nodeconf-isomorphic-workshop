## Backend

This backend is deployed using [webtask](https://webtask.io/), which allows you to run server-side code with no provisioning or deployment.

To deploy, we only need to call `wt create banode-conf.js`. For more information, [see the docs](https://webtask.io/docs/101) or [try it](https://webtask.io/cli).
