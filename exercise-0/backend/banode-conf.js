This talk highlights the many problems related to Unicode in JavaScript regular expressions, demonstrates how ES6 aka. ES2015 helps solve these issues, and glimpses at possible future improvements to ECMAScript regular expressions.",

If you are lucky enough, your product will be successful and you will have to start worrying about things like authentication, authorization, documentation, validation, rate limiting, geo-redundancy, and no downtime deployments. In this talk I will go over some real life examples of our experience evolving our APIs at Auth0 and some of the tools we use for that.",
